Unidirectonal network with a fixed packet rate

"Radau" is a German term which means "noise" like caused by a "racket" or a "row".

Radau sends out N+R packets per second, and will receive N+R packets in average.
This is intentional to keep a stable network data rate.

In the standard case the number of directed packets (N) is 1
and the number or random packets (R) is 0.

This way it learns, slowly, about the network of other computers running Radau, too.
So each node is able to plot the network and track changes to it.

Today it only offers an archive of network reachability and health.

In the future the goal is to create a secured overlay network which offers secure channels
between nodes, which neither know each other nor can talk to each other.
I call this a BlackNet, because it works a bit like a bunch of Black Holes communicating via Hawking radiation.
It works a bit darker than Darknets then, because it neither does not know a source nor destination IP,
all you need is to know a network key to become part of such a network.
